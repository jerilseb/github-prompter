## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Click the GitHub Prompter icon** while on any GitHub repository page

Since Github API can hit the rate limits pretty easily, the extension allows you enter a Github Personal Access Token (PAT) in the options page. No permissions need to be granted to the token for it to work with  Public repositories. The extension will also work with Private repositories if you give repository access to the token. The token is saved securely in the browser storage and is used only for Github API calls.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Need to access private repos or avoid rate limits? Add a GitHub token:

1. Click the **⚙️ icon** in the extension popup
2. Generate a token from [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
3. Paste your token and save!
